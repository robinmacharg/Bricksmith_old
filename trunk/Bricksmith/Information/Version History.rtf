\b \

\b0 \

\b Bricksmith 2.4:\

\b0 64-bit\
Viewports fill their entire area (always correctly now, unlike last time I had that feature)\
Focus rings are drawn by Cocoa, so they look much nicer. They can also be drawn independently of the frame, elimitating extra redraws when tabbing between views.\
Eliminated extra redraws when clicking but not actually changing the selection.\
Mind-boggling speed improvements from recursively flattening part references.\
Fixed bounding-box transforms, which in turn fixed part selection for certain objects\
Supports RGB color syntax\
Traditional-style LDraw output\

\b \
Bricksmith 2.3:\

\b0 Zoom to Fit\
5% faster (by not doing four-way lighting)\
Configurable viewport arrangements\
Views stay scrolled to the center as they change size\
Selecting a part in step display no longer resets the viewing angle\
Reordering or copying steps does not clear the rotation settings\
\

\b Bricksmith 2.2:\

\b0 Middle mouse button activates spin mode\
Supports MacBook trackpad gestures\
Pen tablet eraser deletes parts\
Won't have problems with references to empty submodels\
Won't add "copy X" suffix when reordering models within a file\
Won't zoom to 0%\

\cf0 Part favorites\
Center-click/smooth zoom in Perspective views actually centers the model\

Streamlined UI for entering and navigating Step Display mode\
Eliminated drawer UI.\
Toolbar buttons for Part Browser, Colors, and Inspector\
Improved appearance of lines onscreen\
\
LDraw/ldconfig.ldr is now read correctly\
Renaming a submodel also renames all references to it\
Duplicating a model adds "copy X" suffix\
All model names are forced to end in .ldr (for MLCad and spec compliance)\
Switching to a different submodel while in step display won't cause the previous model to get stuck on the step it was displaying.\
\

\b \
Bricksmith 2.0:\

\b0 Mouse-based part movement\
Drag-and-drop from the Part Browser\
Hotkeys for viewing angles\
No more concern about inverted normals. Results: simpler code, 19% faster, no unilluminated polygons (ex. flowers.dat)\
