		<p>
		The Lego bricks you use in Bricksmith come from a part library called 
		LDraw, maintained by Lego hobbyists  around the world. Their effort is 
		hosted on the Internet at <a href="http://www.ldraw.org">www.ldraw.org</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		<img src="images/LDrawLogo.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 12pt">
		Periodically, LDraw.org releases more official parts. However, the pace 
		of official updates has slowed considerably over the last few years due 
		to an ambitious re-licensing and re-formatting project. But that doesn't 
		mean mean work has stopped. Hundreds of new parts have been designed and 
		certified since the last official update, and you can use them today. 
		You just have to download and install them.
		</p>

		<h3>Downloading Unofficial Parts</h3>
		
		<p>
		There are two ways to download unofficial parts:
			<ul>
				<li>One at a time.</li>
				<li>All at once. (This is the easier route.)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h4>One at a time</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Look up the part number you need (it's usually 
		molded on the bottom of the Lego brick somewhere)</li>
				<li>Search for it on the <a href="http://www.ldraw.org/library/tracker/">LDraw Part Tracker</a>.</li>
				<li>Download it and copy it to LDraw/PARTS</li>
				<li>Check for any listed dependencies or subparts.</li>
				<li>Download them. The website will tell you where they go; usually it's LDraw/P.</li>
				<li>Repeat as needed until you have no more subparts to download. Note that subparts can require other subparts.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<h4>All at once</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="http://www.ldraw.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=14&mode=thread&order=1&thold=0">Download the complete archive</a> of parts in the tracker. <strong>Do not</strong> follow the directions on the website.</li>
				<li>Install. You have two choices for the install location:
					<ul>
						<li>
							LDraw/Unofficial
							<br/>
							Putting them here keeps things 
							clean and neat, but a few applications (notably L3P) 
							don't recognize parts there.
							<br/>
							To install, create this folder and copy the files 
							from the archive into it. You should have 
							LDraw/Unofficial/PARTS, LDraw/Unofficial/P, etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							Manually merge the files into the main LDraw folder.
							<br/>
							All applications will find these parts, but they'll 
							be mixed up with the official parts.
							<br/>
							To install, copy each file into its appropriate 
							LDraw directory. <strong>Do not accidentally 
							overwrite nested folders</strong> such as PARTS/S 
							or P/48.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Making Your New Parts Appear in Bricksmith's Part Browser</h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Bricksmith > Preferences.</li>
				<li>Select the Parts tab.</li>
				<li>Click "Reload Parts" in the LDraw Folder section.</li>
			</ol>

			If you use unofficial parts and want to share your creations with others,
