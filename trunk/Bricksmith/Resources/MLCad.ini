; INTRODUCTION

; The MLCad.ini file tells MLCad's minifig generator which parts are available,
; as well as their position and rotation. This gives you full power over the
; selectable elements, but also means that the chart has to be updated every
; time LDraw releases a new parts update containing minifig parts. You can add
; the new code by yourself, or just download the updated file from
; www.holly-wood.it/mlcad-en.html. Within a few days a LDraw parts update has
; been released the file will be up to date. The numbers in the filename refer
; to the update, the file sticks to.
; Additionally the file defines the order of scanned folders during the launch
; of the program as well as the settings for the proper interaction with LSynth. 


; MINIFIGURE GENERATOR SECTION:

; There is one section per minifig element.
; The section names are mandatory - if they are missing or wrong MLCad uses
; a internal default instead, which is different from the content here!
; Each line has the following format:
; "<Display name>" "<DAT/LDR file name>" <Flags> <Matrix> <Offset>
; <Display name> The name of the element as it is displayed in the element
;                list
; <DAT/LDR file name> The file name of the element or "" for hidden element
; <Flags> always 0 reserved for future use
; <Matrix> a rotation matrix a11 a12 a13 ... a33 for optimal appearance at
;          0 degree rotation angle
; <Offset> The offset of the part to be in place

; ============================================================================
; These sections are read by MLCad V3.10 or higher
; ============================================================================

; SCAN ORDER SECTION:

; The feature has been thought to include unofficial and custom
; parts into MLCad, without the need to mix them with the official LDraw
; parts in the \PARTS and \P folders. DAT files found in the scan will
; be included in the parts library and - depending on the flag - show up in
; the parts tree library and parts preview window.
; Take notice that this feature is NOT equal to the "File > Scan Parts" command
; and therefore will NOT rewrite the Parts.lst file. Other LDraw tools depending
; on the Parts.lst file might not recognise LDR or MPD files containing such
; "external" parts! 
; The start-up of MLCad will be slowed down depending on the number of
; folders and subfolders to be scanned. The syntax supports extended ASCII-code.   
;
; NOTE!
; This is a temporary solution until LDraw.org has agreed on a overall
; solution, which will properly define these things in different ini file. 
;
; Starts with [SCAN_ORDER].
; One line per directory to scan.
; The format of a line is: n = <SHOW|HIDE> [<LDRAWDIR>]["]Pathname["]
; SHOW ........ Will display the parts found inside this directory in the
;               part-library and/or part-preview window
; HIDE ........ Will NOT show the parts found inside this directory in the
;               part-library and/or part-preview window
; <LDRAWDIR> .. keyword to indicate relative paths - this has to be specified with
;		the brackets < >
; Pathname .... Subdirectory inside ldraw base path or absolute path including
;               drive name. Note that if your filename contains spaces, the entire
;               filename must be enclosed in double quotes. (This is standard for
;               any Windows command line with long filenames)
;
; \P, \PARTS and \MODELS are mandatory paths and are always present even if not
; specified. If not declared those will be scaned at last. 
;
; If the keyword <LDRAWDIR> is ommitted the path is assumed to be an absolute path.
;
; Example:
;
; [SCAN_ORDER]
; 1 = HIDE P
; 2 = HIDE <LDRAWDIR>Unofficial\P
; 3 = SHOW <LDRAWDIR>Unofficial\Parts
; 4 = SHOW <LDRAWDIR>My_Parts
; 5 = SHOW <LDRAWDIR>"Authoring\Work in progress"
; 6 = SHOW D:\somedir\somesub


; LSYNTH DEFINITIONS

; Regardless of the order of the statements in the .ini file the combo box will
; sort and list them in alphabetical order.
;
; Starts with [LSYNTH].
; %PATH = <path name> ........... Defines the absolute path to LSynth
;                                 NOTE! (NOT the bin directory!)
; The format of the selectable command lines is: <TITLE> = <COMMAND STRING> 
; TITLE ........... The name displayed in the combo box of the "Add LSynth Command"
;                   dialog.
; COMMAND STRING .. The command to be added to the project. Please refer to
;                   LSynths documentation for a deeper insight.
;
; Example:
;
; [LSYNTH]
; %PATH = "C:\Programs\LSynth"
; 01 - ELECTRIC_NXT_CABLE                   = SYNTH BEGIN ELECTRIC_NXT_CABLE 16
; 02 - ELECTRIC_POWER_FUNCTIONS_CABLE       = SYNTH BEGIN ELECTRIC_POWER_FUNCTIONS_CABLE 16
; 03 - ELECTRIC_RCX_CABLE                   = SYNTH BEGIN ELECTRIC_RCX_CABLE 16
; 04 - FIBER_OPTICS_CABLE                   = SYNTH BEGIN FIBER_OPTICS_CABLE 16


; SUPPORT:

; Feel free to modify the file, but I ask you to send me a copy of it
; to be able to distribute it to other users as well. Send copies to
; holly-wood@holly-wood.it with a calling subject. Please do not send copies
; if using unofficial parts, also make sure you are using the latest part
; libraries from www.LDraw.org.
